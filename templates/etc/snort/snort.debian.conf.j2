# snort.debian.config (Debian Snort configuration file)
#
# This file was generated by the post-installation script of the snort
# package using values from the debconf database.
#
# It is used for options that are changed by Debian to leave
# the original configuration files untouched.
#
# This file is automatically updated on upgrades of the snort package
# *only* if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of that package.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command as root:
#   dpkg-reconfigure snort
